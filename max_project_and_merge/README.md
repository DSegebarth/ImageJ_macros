# max_project_and_merge

This tool is intended to speed up daily work in the lab, when a batch of image files has to be processed in the same way.
This ImageJ Macro can handle up to four channels, perform a maximum projection and brightness-contrast-enhancement on each of them, 
and ultimately merging all channels into an RGB image. 

The user can specify how many channels have to be processed, what values to use for brightness & contrast enhancement, 
and in which color the corresponding channel should be shown in the merged image.

Once these values are set and the macro is run, the user will be prompted to select the input and the output directory.

> Comprehensive user-guide to come.

If you need help to use this macro or have any feedback for us, please donÂ´t hesitate to get in touch!
